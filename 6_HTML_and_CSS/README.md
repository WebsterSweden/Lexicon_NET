# HTML

*Your assignment is to build a basic HTML page structure, for use in later exercises. Don't focus at all on styling at this point – only make the HTML elements and their contents. Refer to W3Schools and Pluralsight for information on how to implement the required features.*

## Required Features:

* The page should be encoded using the UTF-8 character set
* A page title, defined in the head element.
* A header element containing a heading (h1) with the page name. It should also have a nav element with an unordered list of at least 3 links
* A container element for the main content of the page, containing a heading (h2), a paragraph of text and two article elements. Each should have filler text - at least 2 paragraphs each. One should have an image (use http://lorempixel.com/)
* A aside element, containing a heading (h2) and an unordered list of nations, each list item containing an ordered list of the nation's three biggest cities
* A footer element, containing a copyright symbol and your name

# CSS

*In this assignment, you will take a complete HTML page (the one you made in the HTML fundamentals exercise), and style it using CSS. You are not allowed to make modifications to the page – it should be unchanged, with the possible exception of adding classes or ids to elements.*

## Required Features:

* All text on the page should use a sans-serif font family.
* The page should be 1024 pixels wide, and be centered on the page, with equal margins to the left and right.
* Give the page the appearance of the example placed in picture below, using only your own CSS code.

*(The gray boxes show where elements should be positioned – you do not need them to appear as gray boxes on the page)*

### Optional:
* The second paragraph of the first article element should be written in bold text, with a blue text colour.
* In the unordered list in the side content, items should appear in alternating colours (green and red, as a suggestion).

### Code Requirements:

All the CSS code should come from the same file, and be linked into the HTML file through a link tag – there should be no style tags or style attributes in the HTML file at all.
